# AutoMineSim - Current State (March 2025)
AutoMineSim is a real-time 3D mining simulator where an autonomous mining truck navigates a mine site, extracts resources, and avoids hazards. The game features a basic UI for starting and exiting, with future expansion potential for upgrades and additional mechanics.

Current Features:
âœ… Autonomous Mining Truck: Moves toward ore deposits and extracts resources.
âœ… Resource Extraction: Collects materials like Gold, Copper, Diamond, Iron Ore, Lead, Uranium, and Zinc.
âœ… Hazard System: Player places hazards (e.g., rocks, terrain obstacles, and other trucks) to challenge the AI pathfinding.
âœ… Basic UI: Displays game start prompt, exit options, and potential for future expansions.
âœ… Bullet Physics Integration: Realistic physics-based movement and collisions.
âœ… GLFW & OpenGL Rendering: Visual representation of the mining truck, terrain, and objects.

Current Issues & Next Steps:
ðŸš§ Truck Stopping Issue: Needs debugging to ensure smooth navigation after mining.
ðŸš§ Mining Delay: Implementing a pause at resources before moving to the next target.
ðŸš§ Hazard Placement Accuracy: Adjusting placement logic to ensure precise mouse click placement.
ðŸš§ Improved Visuals: Adding 3D models for the mining truck, ores, and terrain instead of basic blocks.
ðŸ”§ Next Up:

Fix physics/movement bugs.
Improve UI for in-game interactions.
Integrate proper mining animations and models.
